### Description

This is a BETA version of NChat. It's not 100% complete, but it works mostly :P. NChat is a serverless chat application for use on a home / school / office network. It's been 4 years in the making, as a 'I'm bored' project. It's won an award on a1vbcode.com, and is critically acclaimed by numerous web-sites and individuals. It boasts many, many features, including AI, HTML 'schemes', NO servers needed over a network, animated emoticons, VBScript support, earn rewards by chatting, create your own emote packs, plus HEAPS more. You need to see the screenshot to get the full picture. This is a re-upload of a previous entry, coz the download link didn't work, and was outta date anyways. NOTE: THIS IS A BETA VERSION. NO PLANNED UPDATES ARE INTENDED FOR THIS PROJECT. CHECK OUT THE **NEW** NCHAT AT WWW.SOLIDINC.TK. Comments are appreciated, and votes if your generous. Support open-source software!
