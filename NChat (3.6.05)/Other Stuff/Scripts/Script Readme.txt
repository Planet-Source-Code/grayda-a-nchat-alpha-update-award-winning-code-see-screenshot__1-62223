THIS IS NOT A SCRIPT!!
----------------------

This is just a general rundown on do's and dont's for writing NChat Scripts:

DO

- Comment lines where necessary. It'll make my life, and any scripters lives, easy.

- Avoid using excessive do loops. This will cause the script control to constantly ask whether or not to continue. Increasing script timeouts helps, but can cause problems if more than one script is run at once.

- Make all scripts available for others to modify. For example, if they want to base their script off yours, let them. Any scripts submitted to www.solidinc.tk are automatically made freeware, unless some other kind of non-payment method is required (eg. Goodwill-ware, where to use an item, you have to do a good deed, or word-ware, where you have to encourage someone to download the file, visit the site etc.)

- Ask some VBScript experts for help with your script before asking me. SUBS.WriteStuff, SUBS.Data etc. Work 100%. If they don't, then it's problem with NChat itself, and you need to visit the forums for help. Otherwise, it's your script, sort it out yourself :)

- Make your script bandwidth friendly. If NChat can handle that function normally, then let it. No 'enhanced' Notch functions 

DON'T

- Be a time hog. Other scripts may need to work. Make it clean and simple. Start up, sort some info, punch out. Easy?

- Shareware hurts everyone. Free is better (Like NChat!)

- Create scripts about nothing useful. Scripts to print what the time is aren't needed. Just set Notch to use the +time+ function.

- Let scripts run without the proper triggering. Already I see people using Notch to reply after EVERY message, but using a blank wildcard. This falls into the last scripting "DO" (above)

- I don't think Notch (or windows) can handle documents made for linux, or apple macs, so don't try. Please. I don't want to be opening a script to take a look, only to find out it was scribbled down by a linux user in a text editor. (No offence. Linux rocks harder than windows, but windows is easier to program with. Sorry)
