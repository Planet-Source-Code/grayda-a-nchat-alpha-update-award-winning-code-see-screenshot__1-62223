Some things have changed since Build 8:

- ALL the profiles didn't copy correctly, because of a Resource Error, that has now been fixed

- HOPEFULLY the little error with the Private messages have been fixed (WHen you double clicked, ALL the messages were opened, and not just all from ONE user

- Help file is now complete, with links and everything

- Help can be called from the Help menu in NChat

- Script support has been removed (More of a hinderance than help)

- The Help Form has been removed, because the help file is here!! :)

- This changes file now exists! Wooooo!

- Some pictures added to the store, to give the illusion of coolness

- Testing bug removed (Caused NChat to not work AT ALL on some comps)

- Plus some more fixes, additions, removals, and other junk

- A SMALL amount of code optimization, and a LOT of picture optimizations!

- License file. Please read it, coz it tells you what you can and can't do with my code

- The port structure of NChat has been changed. Those damn admins have blocked access to any NChat below Alpha at my school, and I hope that fixes it, and some other problems.

- New REALLY cool splash screen included. Uses Pixel-by-Pixel rendering for transparent PNGs

- Modules 1, 2 and 3 have been sorted, and placed into more appropriately named modules

- A whole lot more of the code is commented, just so it's easier for others to understand

- Some comments added. More to come! Don't understand anything? E-Mail me!!

- Notch has been updated, and now supports con, dis and several other NChat commands

- Oh, by the way, the help file has been fixed, and slightly updated

- NChat now sits at ~1000kb big!
- You can now have unlimited Chat windows going. No longer restricted to 50 or 100

- There is an Autobot help file now. You can learn how to program Notch, and a sample file is included

- FINALLY! The file transfer system has had a MASSIVE overhaul and should now work

- A bug with the Whiteboard was fixed, which made all pictures look funny if hovered over

- Another bug (who would have guessed?!? :) ) was fixed involving user icons not being changed when selected through the options.

- Notch has been updated significantly, using a new INI based system. This means more interactivity can be obtained! Woah...

- NChat is now 80% Windows ME and lower compliant! (See Readme for more info)

- MASSIVE PM Bug fixed, where about 1,000,000 PMs were loaded into one window.

- PM window now has scrollbars! :|

- Once again the room creation portion of NChat now works! I forgot that the sckRooms winsock had to be on the same port :@. Damn I'm stupid sometimes

- Significant work done on the File Transfer, and at one stage, actually started to transfer files! WOAH! BUt not it doesn't work again :(

- Notch (The NChat Room Robot) can now LEARN new words through interaction

- NChat is now Internet Compatible! The server source is included! WOOOOOHOHOHOHOHOHOOOOO!

- Text highlighting has been removed, because could cause a security error in Windows ME, where texts were not highlighted (in essence, white highlighted text on white background)

- Nearly 99% of data-parsing errors relating to Result() have been fixed, because the SplitVB5 function DIDN'T add a critical extra delimiter to the end! Seemed to work alright before...

- Some custom icon support. Needs to be updated though

- Icon system now changed from integer based (ie. 1 = Default, 2 = Devil) to just text (Default = Default, Devil = Devil)

- Several subs re-written for speed purposes (Namely the double click sub for ListView1 on frmMain)

- Several "searching" subs written. You can now find a specfic private chat window, a free private chat window, a user in List1 in frmMain, as well as retrieving the INDEX of an icon name (ie Default = 1, Devil = 2 etc)

- Notch's AI has been totally re-written. It was temperamental and was not the best for over private messaging. It now uses a re-vamped AI system, which is faster, and almost 100% compatible with slightly incorrect INI files.

- Random word function has been removed, because it returned data headers (eg. 'svrøThis' instead of just 'This'. The guessing game was going nowhere anyways :)

- File transfer and custom icon sending have been removed. Neither of them worked

- Ha ha ha...  Server. The menu for connecting to a server has been removed for the time being. Server didn't work either.

- While on the topic of servers, NChat now uses HTML for profiles and chatting, just like a web-page! oooh!

- How did that last one relate to servers? nm. modRTB is now known as modText, simply because there is only 2 RTB functions, instead of 3. And it wasn't really just functions for

- Now starting to compile NChat packages. They are available off the web-site, and can enhance NChat's functions. New smileys, profiles, AI Scripts and VBScripts. All available for free off the web-site.

- frmWelcome now exists. People can set up NChat through this. Makes it seem like a professional application... yeah right

- NChat packages released onto www.solidinc.tk under the NChat forums. More to come!

- Default button bug with frmChat fixed. When you type something and hit return, it will now send. Cool!

- Almost all unnecessary controls on frmChat have been removed. They did nothing, and were experiments with user icons etc.

- Annoying code with 1st private message fixed. You can now send and recieve private messages OK now

- 'Skinning' of frmChat removed, because it looked unusual with the whiteboard (if you used the 'Solid' theme)

- Tool tips added to frmChat toolbar, to make it easier to work out what each button does

- frmDownloads tweaked to point DIRECTLY to the packs page. No more browsing!!

- Project was on hold for several months while another programmer worked on it. No changes were made, so project has resumed, and is being developed for use over the internet

- Basic Data Check in place. SHA-Hash of data is created and checked against incoming data. Mismatched hashes are deemed to be faulty, and are not delivered to all recipients.

- Data is now standardised. ALL Data contains a username, SHA-Hash and IP information header, for ease of use.
